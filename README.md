# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction-using-Machin-learning-

In this project, I am  predicting the price of cryptocurrencies using Machine Learning Algorithms. This project predict the price of  4 cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin(BTC), Litecoin(LTC), Ethereum(ETC), and Basic Authentication Token(BAT). The model shows predictions depending on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) using 3 different Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. These algorithms are Long Short – term Model (LSTM), bi – Long Short – Term Model (bi – LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
